SAMS (Student Attendance Management System) is a MERN stack web application designed to streamline student attendance tracking. It enables faculty to mark attendance, view reports, and analyze trends through an interactive dashboard. Built with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, SAMS ensures secure authentication, role-based access, and a responsive UI using React-Bootstrap. The system automates attendance calculations, provides student profiles with attendance history, and allows data export for analysis, making attendance management more efficient and organized.
